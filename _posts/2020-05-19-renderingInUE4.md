Hey folks!

Here is an article I wrote for [ZuruTech Italy](https://zuru.tech/) where I give you a high-level introduction to the **Unreal Engine 4 rendering process**: [Real time rendering and Unreal Engine 4](https://blog.zuru.tech/graphics/2020/04/23/renderinginue4).

I recommend this if you're pretty new to the topic and you want to have an overview of how the engine approaches common real-time rendering problems with some practical performance tips.

Enjoy!
