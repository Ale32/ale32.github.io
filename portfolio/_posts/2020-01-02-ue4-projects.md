During my job at [Rainbow CGI](https://www.rbw-cgi.it/en/home/), I've deeply used **Unreal Engine 4** to develop several real time applications, mainly VR experiences.

I've been the development **lead** of a team of 10 people, composed by 3 developers and 7 artists. I've worked mainly on VR projects, developing apps for both *Oculus Rift* and *HTC Vive*, and apps for mobile.

My role was to guide the content creation to allow the applications to run on different platforms and reach the FPS target, that is 90 frames per second on VR headsets to have the best user experience. I've also developed the interaction systems to let the user interact without controllers with the virtual experience.

Here is the main deployed products:

- [Leonardo DaVinci Experience](http://www.lavenaria.it/it/mostre/leonardo-genio-mito)
- [Caravaggio Experience](https://www.arteinworld.com/caravaggio-experience-a-torino-la-mostra-multimediale-delle-opere-del-merisi/)
- [Forhans 3D mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rainbowcgi.UragmeEng): interactive VR experience designed for *Android* and *Apple* devices to promote the brand.
- [ReHub-VR](https://www.idego.it/virtual-reality/rehub-vr/): developed for a degree course in *Techniques of Psychiatric Rehabilitation of the Rome university “Tor Vergata”*. The objective of this project: design a cognitive, semantics and socio-relational rehabilitation protocol through Virtual Reality for psychotic disorders.
