I'm a software developer in the **Computer Graphics** field, focused on **graphics programming for real time rendering**.

Currently, I work in [Zuru Tech](https://zuru.tech/), developing graphics and rendering features in **Unreal Engine 4** and doing research for improving the quality and the performance of the application.

I've also 3 years experience as a pipeline developer writing python tools for *VFX* and *animation* studios. I've started in Rome for the [Rainbow CGI](https://www.rbw-cgi.it/en/home/), then I moved to London for the [MPC - Moving Picture Company](https://www.mpcfilm.com/), where I have worked on movies like *The Lion King* and *Maleficient 2*.

Recently, I'm diving in to the **Computer Vision** world, following studies on machine learning.
