Currently, at [ZuruTech Italy](https://zuru.tech/), I'm diving into the **Unreal Engine rendering code** to develop new graphics features and to do research for improving the quality and the performance of the studio's application.

You'll see some articles in the [Zuru Tech Blog](https://blog.zuru.tech/) about what we do to the renderer to better match our needs: here is the first, [Real time rendering and Unreal Engine 4](https://blog.zuru.tech/graphics/2020/04/23/renderinginue4), where I discuss a high-level overview of the rendering process in the engine.

During my experience at [Rainbow CGI](https://www.rbw-cgi.it/en/home/), after the initial pipeline developer role, I've expressed interest in real time technologies and so I've started - and ended up doing for the next 2 years - working with **Unreal Engine 4**. I've developed several real time applications, mainly VR experiences.

I've been the development **lead** of a team of 10 people, composed by 3 developers and 7 artists. I've worked mainly on projects for *Oculus Rift*, *HTC Vive*, and applications for mobile devices.

My role was to guide the content creation to allow the applications to run on different platforms and reach the FPS target, which is ideally 90 frames per second on VR headsets to have the best user experience. I've also developed the interaction systems to let the user interact without controllers with the virtual experience.

Here are some of the deployed products:

- [Leonardo DaVinci Experience](http://www.lavenaria.it/it/mostre/leonardo-genio-mito)
- [Caravaggio Experience](https://www.arteinworld.com/caravaggio-experience-a-torino-la-mostra-multimediale-delle-opere-del-merisi/)
- [Forhans 3D mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rainbowcgi.UragmeEng): interactive VR experience designed for *Android* and *Apple* devices to promote the brand.
- [ReHub-VR](https://www.idego.it/virtual-reality/rehub-vr/): developed for a degree course in *Techniques of Psychiatric Rehabilitation of the Rome university “Tor Vergata”*. The objective of this project: design a cognitive, semantics and socio-relational rehabilitation protocol through Virtual Reality for psychotic disorders.
