Here are some projects I've done using **Unreal Engine 4** during my job at [Rainbow CGI](https://www.rbw-cgi.it/en/home/).

I've been the development **lead** of a team of 8/10 people, composed by 3 developers and 5/7 artists. I've worked on VR projects mainly, on both desktop (*Oculus Rift* and *HTC Vive* platforms) and mobile (both *Android* and *iOS*).
